    "detailed_description": "<strong>** Please read this section before purchasing! **</strong><br>- OVR Toolkit *only* supports Windows 10 and 11! Not Windows 7 or Windows 8. Windows 8.1 'may' work but is unsupported!<br>- OVR Toolkit *requires* you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account.<br><strong>- Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!)</strong><br><br><strong>Oculus Rift/S or Oculus Quest/2 users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2><br>OVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type.<br><br>Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease!<br><br>OVR Toolkit is compatible with all SteamVR compatible headsets. The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.)<br></li><li> Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you.<br></li><li> Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you.<br></li><li> Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world.<br></li><li> Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!)<br></li><li> Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them.<br></li><li> Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click.<br></li><li> Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!)<br></li><li> Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as CPU/GPU/VRAM usage.<br></li><li> Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch!<br></li><li> Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings!<br></li><li> Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly!<br></li><li> Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too)<br></li><li> Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification.<br></li><li> Macros: Create macro keybinds which can be activated by a click on the wrist to trigger a series of key presses. (Such as changing OBS scenes, muting/un-muting Discord, etc.)<br></li><li> Paste to Game: Clicking the Paste button found under the keyboard will automatically tab in the currently running game and push Ctrl and V. (Can be used to paste links into VRChat video players, paste join codes into codes, etc.) </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customization</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI.<br></li><li> Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI.<br></li><li> Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications.<br></li><li> Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again?

    "about_the_game": "<strong>** Please read this section before purchasing! **</strong><br>- OVR Toolkit *only* supports Windows 10 and 11! Not Windows 7 or Windows 8. Windows 8.1 'may' work but is unsupported!<br>- OVR Toolkit *requires* you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account.<br><strong>- Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!)</strong><br><br><strong>Oculus Rift/S or Oculus Quest/2 users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2><br>OVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type.<br><br>Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease!<br><br>OVR Toolkit is compatible with all SteamVR compatible headsets. The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.)<br></li><li> Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you.<br></li><li> Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you.<br></li><li> Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world.<br></li><li> Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!)<br></li><li> Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them.<br></li><li> Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click.<br></li><li> Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!)<br></li><li> Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as CPU/GPU/VRAM usage.<br></li><li> Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch!<br></li><li> Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings!<br></li><li> Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly!<br></li><li> Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too)<br></li><li> Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification.<br></li><li> Macros: Create macro keybinds which can be activated by a click on the wrist to trigger a series of key presses. (Such as changing OBS scenes, muting/un-muting Discord, etc.)<br></li><li> Paste to Game: Clicking the Paste button found under the keyboard will automatically tab in the currently running game and push Ctrl and V. (Can be used to paste links into VRChat video players, paste join codes into codes, etc.) </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customization</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI.<br></li><li> Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI.<br></li><li> Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications.<br></li><li> Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again? Now you can!)<br></li><li> Custom Apps allow web developers to integrate web apps into OVR Toolkit, allowing for integrated Twitch chat and games to be made.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simulator Mode - Controller-free mode</h2><br>'Simulator Mode' is a controller-free mode available in OVR Toolkit.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">If At First You Don’t Succeed... Die, Die Again </h2>Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1252330/extras/Deathloop_Action_02.gif?t=1663851125\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER </h2>Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1252330/extras/Deathloop_Julianna.gif?t=1663851125\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The island Of Blackreef – Paradise Or Prison    </h2>Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself.
